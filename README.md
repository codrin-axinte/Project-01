## SCRUM
### Burndown Charts

Burndown charts show work remaining over time. Work remaining is the Y axis and time is the X axis. The work remaining should jig up and down and eventually trend downward.

The Scrum books define a sprint burndown chart as a place to see daily progress, and a product burndown chart as where to show monthly (per sprint) progress.

### Velocity

In Scrum, velocity is how much product backlog effort a team can handle in one sprint. This can be estimated by viewing previous sprints, assuming the team composition and sprint duration are kept constant. It can also be established on a sprint-by-sprint basis, using commitment-based planning.

Once established, velocity can be used to plan projects and forecast release and product completion dates.

How can velocity computations be meaningful when backlog item estimates are intentionally rough? The law of large numbers tends to average out the roughness of the estimates.

### Sprint

An iteration of work during which an increment of product functionality is implemented. By the book, an iteration lasts 30 days. This is longer than in other agile methods to take into account the fact that a functional increment of product must be produced each sprint.

The sprint starts with a one-day sprint planning meeting. Many daily Scrum meetings occur during the sprint (one per day). At the end of the sprint we have a sprint review meeting, followed by a sprint retrospective meeting.

During the sprint, the team must not be interrupted with additional requests. Guaranteeing the team won't be interrupted allows it to make real commitments it can be expected to keep.

Out of practical necessity, some teams choose to bend this rule by declaring some team members 80 percent available at the outset so they still have some cycles left for "Priority One" bugs and emergencies. But this is a slippery slope and should be avoided whenever possible.


### Sprint Goals

Sprint goals are the result of a negotiation between the product owner and the development team.

Meaningful goals are specific and measurable. Instead of "Improve scalability" try "Handle five times as many users as version 0.8."

Scrum focuses on goals that result in demonstrable product. The product owner is entitled to expect demonstrable product (however small or flimsy) starting with the very first Sprint. In iterative development, subsequent Sprints can increase the robustness or size of the feature set.

Have your team commit to goals that anyone will be able to see are met (or not met) at the end of the sprint. At sprint review meetings, the sprint demonstration is conducted after which the team asks the product owner whether (s)he feels the goals were met.

While some specific product backlog items may not be done at the end of a sprint, it should be very unusual for a team not to meet its sprint goals. Scrum requires the team to notify the product owner as soon as it becomes aware it will not meet its goals.

### Sprint Task

In Scrum, a sprint task (or task) is a unit of work generally between four and sixteen hours. Team members volunteer for tasks. They update the estimated number of hours remaining on a daily basis, influencing the sprint burndown chart. Tasks are contained by backlog items.

Scrum literature encourages splitting a task into several if the estimate exceeds twelve hours.

### Scrum Roles

There are three essential roles in any Scrum project:

Product Owner
ScrumMaster
Team

### Release

The transition of an increment of potentially shippable product from the development team into routine use by customers. Releases typically happen when one or more sprints has resulted in the product having enough value to outweigh the cost to deploy it.

"The product is released to customer or marketplace obligations. The release balances functionality, cost, and quality requirements against date commitments." (Schwaber/Beedle, Agile Software Development with Scrum, p. 80).

### Impediments

Anything that prevents a team member from performing work as efficiently as possible is an impediment. Each team member has an opportunity to announce impediments during the daily Scrum meeting. The ScrumMaster is charged with ensuring impediments get resolved. ScrumMasters often arrange sidebar meetings when impediments cannot be resolved on the spot in the daily Scrum meeting.


### Daily Scrum Meeting

A fifteen-minute daily meeting for each team member to answer three questions:

"What have I done since the last Scrum meeting? (i.e. yesterday)"
"What will I do before the next Scrum meeting? (i.e. today)"
"What prevents me from performing my work as efficiently as possible?"
The ScrumMaster ensures that participants call sidebar meetings for any discussions that go too far outside these constraints.

The Scrum literature recommends that this meeting take place first thing in the morning, as soon as all team members arrive.

### ScrumMaster Role

The ScrumMaster is a facilitator for the team and product owner. Rather than manage the team, the ScrumMaster works to assist both the team and product owner in the following ways:

Remove the barriers between the development and the product owner so that the product owner directly drives development.
Teach the product owner how to maximize return on investment (ROI), and meet his/her objectives through Scrum.
Improve the lives of the development team by facilitating creativity and empowerment.
Improve the productivity of the development team in any way possible.
Improve the engineering practices and tools so that each increment of functionality is potentially shippable.
Keep information about the team's progress up to date and visible to all parties.
