### Brief Description

The game plot is to survive as much as you can, runnig from the chaser. 
Also there are some other features like **patrols** and **traps** which will increase the difficulty.
User is able to choose his and enemies color as he likes.

### About the enemies
 * Chaser will follow it's target until he catches it.
 * Patrol will move to random points on the map, if the player enters in his proximity range he will start chase the player until he will exit out of the range.
 * Trap/Obstacle are steady objects meant to harden the player's survival. Traps are randomly placed on the map.
